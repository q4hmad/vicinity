# _Vicinity_

#### _An app for residents of large apartment buildings_

This project is built on Rails

#### By _Qudsia Ahmad_

### Description

_Vicinity is an app for residents of large buildings to securely find and connect with goods and services at their place of residence. It allows users who are registered tenants of a building to log in to the app via a username and password given them at the time of signing. Residents can then post services, for free, trade or sell, and can view other residents' postings as well._





### User Stories
- _non-residents of the building should only be able to see the static pages under the about us tab._
- _A user should be able to log in only after receiving a username from the admin._
- _A user should be able to see all services being offered by fellow residents of that particular building._
- _A user should be able to add, edit and delete only their own service(s).
- An admin, added via rails console, should be able to see and manage all pages._
